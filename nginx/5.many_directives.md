# Common Nginx Directives: `root`, `location`, `user`, `index`

Nginx uses various directives in its configuration file to control server behavior. Here are explanations and examples for some of the most commonly used directives:

---

## `root` Directive

The `root` directive specifies the root directory for requests. It tells Nginx where to look for files to serve.

**Example:**
```nginx
server {
    root /var/www/html;
    ...
}
```
In this example, Nginx will look for files in `/var/www/html` when serving requests.

---

## `location` Directive

The `location` directive is used to define how Nginx should process requests for specific URIs or paths. It allows you to set different rules for different parts of your website.

**Example:**
```nginx
server {
    location /images/ {
        root /data;
    }
}
```
This configuration serves files from `/data/images/` when a request starts with `/images/`.

---

## `user` Directive

The `user` directive sets the system user and group that Nginx worker processes will run as. This is important for security and permissions.

**Example:**
```nginx
user www-data;
```
Here, Nginx worker processes will run as the `www-data` user.

---

## `index` Directive

The `index` directive defines the default file(s) to serve when a directory is requested.

**Example:**
```nginx
server {
    index index.html index.htm;
}
```
If a user requests a directory, Nginx will look for `index.html` or `index.htm` to serve as

sample:
```nginx
user morteza;

events {

}

http {
    server {
        server_name 127.0.0.1;
        listen 81;
        root /home/morteza/Desktop/blog/;
        index about.html;
        location /docs/ {
            index doc.html;
        }
    }
}
```
