# ngx_http_auth_basic_module

The `ngx_http_auth_basic_module` provides basic HTTP authentication for restricting access to resources on your Nginx server.

## `auth_basic` Directive

The `auth_basic` directive enables basic authentication and sets the authentication realm (the message shown in the login prompt).

**Example:**
```nginx
location /secure/ {
    auth_basic "Restricted Area";
    auth_basic_user_file /etc/nginx/.htpasswd;
}
```
In this example, users accessing `/secure/` will be prompted to enter a username and password.

## `auth_basic_user_file` Directive

The `auth_basic_user_file` directive specifies the path to the password file (usually generated with `htpasswd`). This file contains usernames and encrypted passwords.

**Example:**
```nginx
auth_basic_user_file /etc/nginx/.htpasswd;
```

---

To create the `.htpasswd` file, use the `htpasswd` tool:
```bash
htpasswd -c /etc/nginx/.htpasswd username
```

With these directives, you can easily protect sensitive areas of your website
