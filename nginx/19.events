# Events and Worker Settings in Nginx

Nginx uses a multi-process, event-driven architecture to handle many simultaneous connections efficiently.

---

## `worker_processes` Directive

The `worker_processes` directive sets the number of worker processes Nginx will spawn. More worker processes can help Nginx handle more simultaneous connections.

**Example:**
```nginx
worker_processes auto;
```
Setting it to `auto` lets Nginx choose the optimal number based on CPU cores.

## `events` Block

The `events` block contains directives related to connection processing.

**Example:**
```nginx
events {
    worker_connections 1024;
}
```

---

## `worker_connections` Directive

The `worker_connections` directive (inside the `events` block) sets the maximum number of simultaneous connections that each worker process can handle.

**Example:**
```nginx
events {
    worker_connections 1024;
}
```
If you have 4 worker processes and 1024 worker connections, Nginx can handle up to 4096 simultaneous connections (subject to OS limits).
