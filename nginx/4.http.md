# The HTTP Core in Nginx

The **http** core module in Nginx is responsible for handling web traffic over the HTTP and HTTPS protocols. Most web server configurations in Nginx are placed inside the `http` context in the main configuration file (`nginx.conf`).

## Writing the HTTP Context in the Config File

The `http` context is defined using curly braces `{}` and contains directives that control how Nginx processes HTTP requests. Inside the `http` block, you can define settings for logging, MIME types, server blocks, and more.

**Example:**
```nginx
http {
    include       mime.types;
    default_type  application/octet-stream;

    server {
        listen 80;
        server_name example.com;

        location / {
            root /var/www/html;
            index index.html;
        }
    }
}
```

- The `http` block can contain multiple `server` blocks, each representing a virtual host.
- Directives inside the `http` context apply to all servers defined within it.

## Testing the Configuration with `-t`

After editing the Nginx configuration file, you should always test it for syntax errors before reloading or restarting the service. Use the following command:

```bash
sudo nginx -t
```

- If the configuration is correct, you will see a message like:  
  `syntax is ok`  
  `test is successful`
- If there are errors, Nginx will display details to help you fix them.

Testing your configuration helps prevent downtime and ensures Nginx will
