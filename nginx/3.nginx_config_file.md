# Nginx Configuration File Explained

The main configuration file for Nginx is usually located at `/etc/nginx/nginx.conf`. This file controls how Nginx behaves and how it handles web traffic.

## Nginx Processes

Nginx uses a multi-process architecture with two main types of processes:

### 1. Master Process
- The **master process** is responsible for reading and evaluating configuration files, managing worker processes, and handling signals (such as reload or stop).
- It does not handle client requests directly.

### 2. Worker Processes
- **Worker processes** do the actual work of handling client requests, processing connections, and serving content.
- Each worker process is single-threaded and handles multiple connections asynchronously.

This design allows Nginx to handle many simultaneous connections efficiently.

## What is a Directive in the Config File?

A **directive** is a single instruction in the Nginx configuration file. Each directive controls a specific aspect of Nginxâ€™s behavior, such as setting the server name, specifying the root directory, or defining access rules.

**Example:**
```nginx
worker_processes  4;
```
This directive sets the number of worker processes to 4.

## What is a Context in the Config File?

A **context** is a block in the configuration file that groups related directives together. Contexts are defined by curly braces `{}` and determine where certain directives can be used.

Common contexts include:
- **main**: The top-level context, outside any blocks.
- **http**: Contains configuration for web traffic.
- **server**: Defines settings for a specific virtual server.
- **location**: Specifies how to process requests for specific URIs.

**Example:**
```nginx
http {
    server {
        listen 80;
        location / {
            root /var/www/html;
        }
    }
}
```
Here, `server` is inside the `http` context, and `location` is inside the `server` context.
