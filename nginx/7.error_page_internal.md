# The `error_page` and `internal` Directives in Nginx

Nginx provides powerful directives to control how errors are handled and how certain locations are accessed.

## `error_page` Directive

The `error_page` directive allows you to specify custom pages for different HTTP error codes. This improves user experience by displaying friendly error messages instead of default server responses.

**Example:**
```nginx
server {
    listen 80;
    server_name example.com;

    error_page 404 /custom_404.html;
    location = /custom_404.html {
        root /var/www/html;
        internal;
    }
}
```
In this example, when a 404 error occurs, Nginx serves `/custom_404.html` from the `/var/www/html` directory.

## `internal` Directive

The `internal` directive restricts access to a location so that it can only be used for internal redirects, not accessed directly by clients.

**Usage:**
- When you mark a location as `internal`, users cannot request it directly via their browser.
- It is often used with `error_page` to prevent users from accessing custom error pages directly.

**Example:**
```nginx
location = /custom_404.html {
