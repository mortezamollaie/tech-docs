# What is a Reverse Proxy?

A **reverse proxy** is a server that sits between client devices and backend servers. It receives requests from clients, forwards them to the appropriate backend server, and then returns the server's response to the client. Unlike a forward proxy, which acts on behalf of clients, a reverse proxy acts on behalf of servers.

## Key Functions of a Reverse Proxy

- **Load Balancing:** Distributes incoming traffic across multiple backend servers to ensure no single server is overwhelmed.
- **Security:** Hides the details of backend servers and can provide an additional layer of security.
- **SSL Termination:** Handles SSL encryption/decryption, reducing the load on backend servers.
- **Caching:** Stores copies of frequently requested content to improve performance and reduce backend load.
- **Compression:** Compresses outgoing data to reduce bandwidth usage.

## How It Works

When a client sends a request, the reverse proxy intercepts it and decides which backend server should handle the request. After processing, the reverse proxy sends the server's response back to the client, making it appear as if the response came directly from the proxy.

## Example

Nginx is a popular web server that is often used as a reverse proxy to manage
