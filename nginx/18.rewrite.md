# URL Rewriting in Nginx

Nginx provides powerful URL rewriting and redirection capabilities using the `rewrite`, `if`, and `return` directives. These are useful for modifying request URIs, redirecting users, or implementing conditional logic.

---

## `rewrite` Directive

The `rewrite` directive modifies the requested URI using regular expressions and can redirect or internally rewrite requests.

**Example:**
```nginx
rewrite ^/old-path/(.*)$ /new-path/$1 permanent;
```
This redirects all requests from `/old-path/...` to `/new-path/...` with a permanent (301) redirect.

---

## `if` Directive

The `if` directive allows you to perform conditional checks based on variables, headers, or request properties.

**Example:**
```nginx
if ($request_method = POST) {
    return 405;
}
```
This returns a 405 error if the request method is POST.

---

## `return` Directive

The `return` directive sends a specific HTTP status code and optionally a redirect URL or message.

**Example:**
```nginx
return 301 https://$host$request_uri;
```
This forces all requests to use HTTPS by redirecting to the secure version of the site.

These directives can be combined to create flexible and powerful URL rewriting and redirection rules in your
