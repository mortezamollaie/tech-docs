# Introduction to Nginx

## What is Nginx?
**Nginx** is an open-source, high-performance web server designed to handle web traffic efficiently. It was initially developed by **Igor Sysoev** in 2004 and has become one of the most popular web servers due to its speed, scalability, and low resource consumption.

Apart from serving as a web server, Nginx can also function as a **Reverse Proxy**, **Load Balancer**, **HTTP Cache**, and even a **Mail Proxy**.

## What does Nginx do?
- **Serving Web Pages**: Delivers static files (HTML, CSS, JS, images, etc.) at high speed.
- **Reverse Proxy**: Forwards client requests to other servers and returns the responses.
- **Load Balancing**: Distributes traffic across multiple servers to improve performance and reliability.
- **SSL/TLS Termination**: Handles secure HTTPS connections.
- **Caching**: Stores frequently accessed content to reduce the load on backend servers.
- **Handling High Concurrency**: Efficiently manages thousands of simultaneous connections with minimal resource usage.
