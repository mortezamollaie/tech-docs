# The HTTP Proxy Module in Nginx

Nginx's HTTP proxy module allows you to forward client requests to another server, making Nginx act as a reverse proxy. This is commonly used to pass requests to backend servers such as application servers or other web servers.

## `proxy_pass` Directive

The `proxy_pass` directive specifies the protocol and address of a proxied server and the URI to which location will be mapped.

**Example:**
```nginx
location /app/ {
    proxy_pass http://127.0.0.1:5000/;
}
```
In this example, any request to `/app/` will be forwarded to `http://127.0.0.1:5000/`.

## `proxy_set_header` Directive

The `proxy_set_header` directive allows you to set or override headers that are sent to the proxied server. This is useful for passing the original client information or customizing the request.

**Example:**
```nginx
location /app/ {
    proxy_pass http://127.0.0.1:5000/;
    proxy_set_header Host $host;
    proxy_set_header X-Real-IP $remote_addr;
    proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-For $proxy_add_x_forwarded_for;
}
```
In this example:
- `Host` passes the original host header.
- `X-Real-IP` passes the client’s real IP address.
- `X-Forwarded-For` appends the client’s IP to the forwarded-for header.

These directives are essential for configuring Nginx as a reverse proxy and ensuring backend servers receive the correct request
