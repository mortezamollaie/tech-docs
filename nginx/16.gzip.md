# Gzip and Brotli Encoding in Nginx

Nginx supports response compression to reduce the size of data sent to clients, improving load times and saving bandwidth. The two most common compression methods are **gzip** and **brotli**.

---

## Gzip Compression

Gzip is a widely supported compression method in browsers and HTTP clients.

### Enabling Gzip in Nginx

```nginx
gzip on;
gzip_types text/plain text/css application/json application/javascript text/xml application/xml application/xml+rss text/javascript;
gzip_min_length 256;
gzip_comp_level 5;
```

- **gzip on;** — Enables gzip compression.
- **gzip_types** — Specifies MIME types to compress.
- **gzip_min_length** — Minimum response size to compress.
- **gzip_comp_level** — Compression level (1-9).

## Brotli Compression

Brotli is a newer compression algorithm that often achieves better compression ratios than gzip. Brotli support requires the [ngx_brotli](https://github.com/google/ngx_brotli) module, which may need to be compiled separately.

### Enabling Brotli in Nginx

```nginx
brotli on;
brotli_types text/plain text/css application/json application/javascript text/xml application/xml application/xml+rss text/javascript;
brotli_comp_level 5;
```

- **brotli on;** — Enables brotli compression.
- **brotli_types** — Specifies MIME types to compress.
- **brotli_comp_level** — Compression level (1-11).

---

## Example Configuration

```nginx
gzip on;
gzip_types text/plain text/css application/json application/javascript;

brotli on;
brotli_types text/plain text/css application/json application/javascript;
```

## Notes

- Brotli is supported by most modern browsers, but gzip is more universally supported.
- You can enable both; Nginx will use brotli if the client supports it, otherwise gzip.
- Compression reduces bandwidth usage and can improve site speed, especially for text
