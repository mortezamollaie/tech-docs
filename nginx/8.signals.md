# Important Nginx Directives and Signals

This guide explains some useful Nginx directives—`worker_processes`, `autoindex`, and `include`—as well as the main signals you can send to the Nginx process.

---

## `worker_processes` Directive

The `worker_processes` directive sets the number of worker processes Nginx will spawn. More worker processes can help Nginx handle more simultaneous connections.

**Example:**
```nginx
worker_processes 4;
```
You can also set it to `auto` to let Nginx automatically choose the optimal number based on CPU cores:
```nginx
worker_processes auto;
```

---

## `autoindex` Directive

The `autoindex` directive enables or disables automatic directory listing when no index file is found in a directory.

**Example:**
```nginx
location /files/ {
    autoindex on;
}
```
With `autoindex on;`, Nginx will display a list of files in the `/files/` directory if no index file is present.

---

## `include` Directive

The `include` directive allows you to include other configuration files into your main configuration. This helps keep your configuration organized and modular.

**Example:**
```nginx
http {
    include /etc/nginx/mime.types;
    include /etc/nginx/conf.d/*.conf;
}
```
This example includes the `mime.types` file and all configuration files in the `conf.d` directory.

## Nginx Signals

Nginx supports several signals that you can send to its master process to control its behavior. Here are four important signals:

1. **reload** (`SIGHUP`): Reloads the configuration file without stopping the service.
   ```bash
   sudo nginx -s reload
   ```
2. **stop** (`SIGTERM`): Gracefully stops the Nginx process.
   ```bash
   sudo nginx -s stop
   ```
3. **quit** (`SIGQUIT`): Gracefully shuts down Nginx after finishing active connections.
   ```bash
   sudo nginx -s quit
   ```
4. **reopen** (`SIGUSR1`): Reopens log files (useful for log rotation).
   ```bash
   sudo nginx -s reopen
   ```

These signals help you manage and control the Nginx server without needing to restart your
