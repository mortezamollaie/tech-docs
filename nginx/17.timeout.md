# Timeout and Keepalive Settings in Nginx

Nginx provides several directives to control connection timeouts and keepalive behavior, which help manage server resources and improve performance.

---

## `keepalive_timeout`

The `keepalive_timeout` directive sets the amount of time a connection to the client will be kept open after sending a response. This allows clients to make multiple requests over the same connection.

**Example:**
```nginx
keepalive_timeout 65;
```
This keeps the connection open for 65 seconds.

---

## `keepalive_requests`

The `keepalive_requests` directive limits the number of requests that can be sent over a single keepalive connection.

**Example:**
```nginx
keepalive_requests 100;
```
After 100 requests, the connection will be closed.

---

## `keepalive_disable`

The `keepalive_disable` directive disables keepalive connections for specified user agents (such as old browsers).

**Example:**
```nginx
keepalive_disable msie6 safari;
```
This disables keepalive for Internet Explorer 6 and Safari.

---

## `send_timeout`

The `send_timeout` directive sets a timeout for transmitting a response to the client. If the client does not receive data within this time, the connection is closed.

**Example:**
```nginx
send_timeout 30s;
```
If the client does not receive any data for 30 seconds, the connection is closed.

---

## `client_body_timeout`

The `client_body_timeout` directive sets the maximum time Nginx will wait to receive the entire request body from the client.

**Example:**
```nginx
client_body_timeout 15s;
```
If the client does not send the request body within 15 seconds, the connection is closed.

These settings help you control how long connections are kept open and how long Nginx waits for data, improving resource management and protecting against
